# tree-spices-classification
This project is about teaching a computer to recognize different tree species using machine learning. By looking at features like leaf shape or images, the model learns to tell trees apart, kind of like how we do by observing nature. Itâ€™s a small step toward using AI to help in areas like forest research, conservation, and education.
